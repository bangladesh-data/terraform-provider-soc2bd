This resource type will create the Connector in the Soc2bd Admin Console, but in order to successfully deploy it, you must also generate Connector tokens that authenticate the Connector with Soc2bd.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "soc2bd" {
  api_token = "1234567890abcdef"
  network   = "mynetwork"
}

resource "soc2bd_remote_network" "aws_network" {
  name = "aws_remote_network"
}

resource "soc2bd_connector" "aws_connector" {
  remote_network_id = soc2bd_remote_network.aws_network.id
}
```
