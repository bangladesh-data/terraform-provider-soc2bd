# Soc2bd Provider

The Soc2bd provider can be used with [Soc2bd](https://www.soc2bd.com) to manage your Remote Networks, Connectors, and Resources through Terraform.

~> **Warning** Using the Soc2bd Terraform provider will cause any secrets, such as Connector tokens or Soc2bd API keys, that are managed in Terraform to be persisted in both Terraform's state file and in any generated plan files. If malicious attackers obtain these credentials, they could intercept network traffic intended for your private network or cause a denial of service event. For any Terraform module that reads or writes Soc2bd secrets, these files should be treated as sensitive and protected accordingly.

## Soc2bd Setup

You need an API key to use Soc2bd's Terraform provider. See our [documentation](https://docs.soc2bd.com/docs/api-overview) for more details about creating an API key. You will also need your network ID, or the prefix of your Soc2bd URL that you use to sign into the Admin Console. For example, if your URL is `autoco.soc2bd.com` your network ID is `autoco`.
